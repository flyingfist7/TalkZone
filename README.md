# Real-Time Chat Application using MERN Stack, JWT, and Socket.io

This is a group project where I developed a real-time chat application using the MERN stack, JWT, and Socket.io. Below are the features and instructions to get it up and running:

## Project Highlights

- Technology stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Socket.io, TailwindCSS, and Daisy UI
- Implemented authentication and authorization using JWT
- Enabled real-time messaging with Socket.io
- Displayed online user status using Socket.io and React Context API
- Managed global state with Zustand
- Included error handling on both server and client sides
- Provided free deployment instructions

## Building the Application

```shell
npm run build
```

## Starting the Application

```shell
npm start
```

## Setting up the .env file

```env
PORT=...
MONGO_DB_URI=...
JWT_SECRET=...
NODE_ENV=...
```

This project showcases our skills in full-stack development, particularly in building interactive and real-time applications with secure authentication.
